The association between social factors and drinking may be related to the ability of individuals to take the perspectives of others' mental and emotional states, defined as empathic processing (EP). As such, it may be the case that EP is associated with social support (SS) and drinking behavior among individuals with AUD, yet few prior studies have attempted to define EP in an AUD sample."

              "AbstractText":"The notion of recovery has become prominent in mental healthcare discourse in the UK, but it is often considered as if it were a relatively novel notion, and as if it represented an alternative to conventional treatment and intervention. In this paper, we explore some of the origins of the notion of recovery in the early 20th century in movements such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Recovery Inc. Whilst these phenomena are not entirely continuous with recovery in the present day, some important antecedents of the contemporary notion can be detected. These include the focus on the sufferers' interior space as a key theatre of operations and the reinforcement and consolidation of medical ways of seeing the condition without any immediate medical supervision of the actors being necessary. This has resonance with many contemporary examples of recovery in practice where the art of living with a mental health condition is emphasised without the nature of the psychopathological condition itself being challenged.",

              "AbstractText":"Adolescence is a time of dramatic changes in brain structure and function, and the adolescent brain is highly susceptible to being altered by experiences like substance use. However, there is much we have yet to learn about how these experiences influence brain development, how they promote or interfere with later health outcomes, or even what healthy brain development looks like. A large longitudinal study beginning in early adolescence could help us understand the normal variability in adolescent brain and cognitive development and tease apart the many factors that influence it. Recent advances in neuroimaging, informatics, and genetics technologies have made it feasible to conduct a study of sufficient size and scope to answer many outstanding questions. At the same time, several Institutes across the NIH recognized the value of collaborating in such a project because of its ability to address the role of biological, environmental, and behavioral factors like gender, pubertal hormones, sports participation, and social/economic disparities on brain development as well as their association with the emergence and progression of substance use and mental illness including suicide risk. Thus, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study was created to answer the most pressing public health questions of our day.",

Within the high subgroup, ALS kindreds presented a significantly higher rate of psychiatric illness than did controls (28 of 39 [71.8%]; mean [SD] number of siblings, 4.29 [1.41]; P\u2009=\u2009.001).

              "AbstractText":"Despite reductions in cigarette smoking in the United States, approximately 40 million Americans are smokers. Innovative interventions are needed to help remaining smokers quit. To develop innovative interventions, precise and effective tools are needed. Here, a laboratory model of smoking relapse is assessed for its ability to detect increased resistance to smoking across 2 interventions and for its sensitivity to differing degrees of effectiveness. Nicotine-deprived participants (N = 36) completed, in randomized order, 4 smoking resistance sessions with and without implementation intentions and monetary incentives. A Cox proportional hazard mixed-effects model indicated significant differences between condition, χ²(3) = 64.87, p < .001, and the Questionnaire on Smoking Urges, χ²(1) = 4.86, p = .03. Comparisons between conditions were used to estimate the effect size of each condition on delay to smoking reinitiation. The implementation intentions intervention had a small effect (d = 0.32), the monetary incentives had a large effect (d = 0.89) and the combination of both interventions had a large effect size (d = 1.20). This initial investigation of the smoking resistance paradigm showed sensitivity to smoking reinitiation across intervention conditions. Individuals resisted smoking significantly more in the presence of monetary incentives and implementation intentions than without these interventions. These results provide support for further examination of these interventions in more translational settings and the use of this laboratory analog to screen future interventions and treatment packages.

              "AbstractText":"Neuroinflammation has been reported to follow chronic ethanol intake and may perpetuate alcohol consumption. Present studies determined the effect of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), known for their anti-inflammatory action, on chronic ethanol intake and relapse-like ethanol intake in a post-deprivation condition. Rats were allowed 12-17 weeks of chronic voluntary ethanol (10% and 20% v/v) intake, after which a single dose of activated hMSCs (5 × 10(5) ) was injected into a brain lateral ventricle. Control animals were administered vehicle. After assessing the effect of hMSCs on chronic ethanol intake for 1 week, animals were deprived of ethanol for 2 weeks and thereafter an ethanol re-access of 60 min was allowed to determine relapse-like intake. A single administration of activated hMSCs inhibited chronic alcohol consumption by 70% (P < 0.001), an effect seen within the first 24 hours of hMSCs administration, and reduced relapse-like drinking by 80% (P < 0.001). In the relapse-like condition, control animals attain blood ethanol ('binge-like') levels >80 mg/dl. The single hMSC administration reduced relapse-like blood ethanol levels to 20 mg/dl. Chronic ethanol intake increased by 250% (P < 0.001) the levels of reactive oxygen species in hippocampus, which were markedly reduced by hMSC administration. Astrocyte glial acidic fibrillary protein immunoreactivity, a hallmark of neuroinflammation, was increased by 60-80% (P < 0.001) by chronic ethanol intake, an effect that was fully abolished by the administration of hMSCs. This study supports the neuroinflammation-chronic ethanol intake hypothesis and suggest that mesenchymal stem cell administration may be considered in the treatment of alcohol use disorders.",

              "AbstractText":"Working in an interdisciplinary manner at the crossroads of alcohol and HIV research is a challenge. This paper presents six novel approaches that could be applied to activities at the intersection of alcohol and HIV. These approaches are (i) address the fact that the availability of new technology is unevenly distributed around the world, (ii) use technology to move beyond both paper and digital surveys, (iii) introduce a focus on advocacy and partnerships with large technology companies, (iv) harness technological innovation to utilise digital counselling, (v) explore the use of virtual reality in both research and delivering interventions, and (vi) consider alternative funding models to those currently in existence to improve efficiencies and innovations. Aiming to understand the interplay of alcohol and HIV will require creativity. The six approaches outlines in this paper provide possible directions from which new approaches may emerge."

Amphetamine maintenance reduces cocaine use in preclinical and clinical studies, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Previous studies indicate a role for endogenous opioid release and subsequent opioid receptor activation in some amphetamine effects; therefore, the current study examined the role of mu-opioid receptor activation in d-amphetamine treatment effects in an assay of cocaine-vs-food choice."

The mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine (0.032-0.32mg/kg/h) dose-dependently increased cocaine choice and decreased rates of reinforcement. A dose of the mu-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (0.0032mg/kg/h) that completely blocked morphine effects had no effect on cocaine choice when it was administered alone, but it enhanced the effectiveness of a threshold dose of 0.032mg/kg/h amphetamine to decrease cocaine choice without also enhancing nonselective behavioral disruption by this dose of amphetamine. Conversely, the kappa-selective opioid antagonist norbinalorphimine did not enhance amphetamine effects on cocaine choice."

              "AbstractText":"Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder with few therapeutic strategies that address the core pathophysiology. Brain tissue loss and oxidative damage are key components of alcoholism, such that reversal of these phenomena may help break the addictive cycle in alcohol use disorder (AUD). The current review focuses on platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), a key modulator of the cerebral endothelial integrity and neuroinflammation, and a targetable transmembrane protein whose interaction within AUD has not been well explored. The current review will elaborate on the function of PECAM-1 in physiology and pathology and infer its contribution in AUD neuropathology. Recent research reveals that oligodendrocytes, whose primary function is myelination of neurons in the brain, are a key component in new learning and adaptation to environmental challenges. The current review briefly introduces the role of oligodendrocytes in healthy physiology and neuropathology. Importantly, we will highlight the recent evidence of dysregulation of oligodendrocytes in the context of AUD and then discuss their potential interaction with PECAM-1 on the cerebral endothelium."

We investigated whether socioeconomic status (education and income), health care factors (insurance, alcoholism treatment), or psychosocial stressors (stressful life events, racial discrimination, alcoholism stigma) could account for black-white differences in the association between AUD and physical and functional health among current women drinkers 25 years and older (N = 8,877) in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Generalized linear regression tested how race interacted with the association between 12-month DSM-IV AUD in Wave 1 (2001-2002) and health in Wave 2 (2004-2005), adjusted for covariates (age group, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis). Black women with AUD had poorer health than white women with AUD (β = -3.18, SE = 1.28, p < .05). This association was partially attenuated after adjusting for socioeconomic status, health care, and psychosocial factors (β = -2.64, SE = 1.27, p < .05). In race-specific analyses, AUD was associated with poorer health for black but not white women. Accounting for black-white differences in AUD and physical and functional health among women requires investigation beyond traditional explanatory mechanisms."

Thus, the objective of this study is to describe neuropsychological performance in this particular population."

Our results suggest that early on, alcohol-dependent subjects develop compensatory adaptation processes to preserve social function and adaptation. Minor cognitive impairments should be screened early in the disease to integrate cognitive interventions into the health-care plan to thus eventually prevent further socio-professional marginalization."

              "AbstractText":"The alkaloid lobeline (Lob) has been studied due to its potential use in treatment of drug abuse. This study evaluates the possible anticonvulsant and neuroprotective activities of Lob to obtain new information on its properties that could confirm it as a candidate in the treatment of alcohol addiction. The anticonvulsant effect of Lob was evaluated using a pilocarpine-induced seizure model. In addition, possible neuroprotective effects were investigated measuring DNA damage using the comet assay, assessing free radical levels by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) oxidation, and measuring the antioxidant potential using the α, α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay, besides measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in brain tissues. Lobeline increased the latency to the first seizure and decreased the percentage of seizures in a similar way as diazepam, used as control. DNA damage induced by Pil and hydrogen peroxide were decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex from mice treated with Lob. The levels of free radicals and CAT activity increased in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, in mice treated with Pil. Lobeline decreased CAT in hippocampus, leading to similar values as in the saline negative control. In conclusion, Lob has anticonvulsant and neuroprotective actions that may be mediated by antioxidant-like mechanisms, indicating its potential as candidate drug in alcoholism therapy."

In mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), inhibition of food intake by the peripherally restricted CB1R antagonist JD5037 could be attributed to endogenous leptin due to the rapid reversal of hyperleptinemia that maintains leptin resistance, but the signaling pathway engaged by leptin has remained to be determined."

              "AbstractText":"Inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis has been used to relieve pain for thousands of years. Today non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which largely inhibit PG synthesis) are widely used to treat pain. Four main types of PGs (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2 and PGI2) are synthesized from arachidonic acid during inflammation and have been demonstrated to impact nociception. PGE2 has been the most studied and utilized for its pain producing properties and has been demonstrated to increase hypersensitivity in rodent nociceptive behavioral models when applied centrally and/or peripherally. Surprisingly, there are no published reports that use withdrawal from radiant light beam (Hargreaves apparatus) to examine the dose response effect of peripherally applied PGE2 on thermal nociceptive hypersensitivity. To address this gap in the literature, we performed a dose response study examining the effect of PGE2 on thermal hypersensitivity (assessed using a Hargreaves apparatus) where rats were injected with 0.003-30μg of PGE2, intradermally into the hindpaw. Thermal hypersensitivity was assessed by measuring withdraw latency from a radiant light beam (Hargreaves test) and our primary objective was to determine the dose of PGE2 causing the most pronounced increase in thermal hypersensitivity (i.e. lowest withdraw latency). A secondary objective was to determine the minimum dose of PGE2 required to cause statistically significant decreases in thermal withdrawal latency as compared to rats injected with vehicle. We found that rats injected with the 30μg dose of PGE2 exhibited the most pronounced thermal nociceptive hypersensitivity though secondary analysis showed that rats injected with PGE2 doses of 0.03-30μg had lower withdrawal latencies as compared to rats injected with vehicle. This work fills an evidence gap and provides context to guide dose selection in future rodent pain behavior studies.",
